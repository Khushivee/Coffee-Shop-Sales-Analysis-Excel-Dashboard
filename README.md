## Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of sales performance for a multi-location coffee shop chain. The objective is to extract meaningful insights that support business decision-making related to revenue growth, customer behavior, operational efficiency, and product strategy.
An interactive Excel dashboard was developed to visualize key metrics including sales, footfall, peak hours, product performance, and monthly trends.
The analysis is structured from a business perspective and demonstrates how data-driven insights can help improve profitability and enhance customer experience.
